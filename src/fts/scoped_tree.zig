//! A B-tree view that keeps one full-text index out of another's way.
//!
//! The dictionary, document lengths, and reverse index are each a single tree
//! shared by every declared index. Without something separating them, a term
//! indexed for one property would be found when searching another — which is the
//! behaviour per-property indexes exist to replace.
//!
//! Every key written through this view carries a four-byte prefix identifying the
//! index it belongs to. Reads prepend the same prefix, so an index sees its own
//! entries and nothing else.
//!
//! ## Why a wrapper rather than threading a prefix through
//!
//! The alternative is passing the prefix to each place that builds a key, of
//! which there are a dozen across three files. Missing one would not fail to
//! compile; it would write an entry that the matching read could never find, or
//! worse, read another index's. Putting the prefix in one place makes that
//! mistake impossible to write rather than merely unlikely.
//!
//! ## The empty prefix
//!
//! A view with no prefix reads and writes keys unchanged, which is what the
//! index built before any of this existed uses. That keeps old data reachable
//! while both schemes are alive.
